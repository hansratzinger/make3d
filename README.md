### Exhaustion adapters 

I was looking to improve the exhaustion of dust when I was working with my cirular saws. I am using a BOSCH GAS 20 L workshop vacuum cleaner and was connecting the hose by using a duck tape. But changing the hose to the different machines was difficult. To solve this problem I contructed the adapters you can find here and use for your own work.

The adapters for the saws can be connected with the ones for the hoses by screwing them together.

To fix the adapter replace the two PT 4.2 x 9 screws with PT-screws 4.2 x 16.

To improve the hold of the adapter on the exhaustion connector of the Einhell use the washer (Dichtungsring) as seen above.

### 3D printing

#### Filaments

For the adapters I used PLA from 3DJAKE
ecoPLA Schwarz https://www.3djake.at/3djake/ecopla-schwarz

For the washer (EINHELL) which has to be flexible I used 
Recreus Filaflex Black https://www.3djake.at/recreus/filaflex-black
