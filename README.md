Models for 3D printing made for my own sharing with the community

## Files

.f3d files - Models are designed in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/free-trial). You can adapt them if needed by editing the .f3d files.

.gcode files are sliced with [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer) for [Anycubic Vyper](https://www.anycubic.com/products/anycubic-vyper)
(the files for the exhaustion adapters are sliced with Cura, but I do recommend now SuperSlicer)

.stl und .3mf files are also included

Find all files here:

## Models

Here you can find 3D models constructed by me for different projects:

- exhaustion adapters

- ladder end caps

- chip for birthdays, gifts, etc

- flower table

- QWIRKLE stand

### Exhaustion adapters

I was looking to improve the exhaustion of dust when I was working with my cirular saws. I am using a BOSCH GAS 20 L workshop vacuum cleaner and was connecting the hose by using a duck tape. But changing the hose to the different machines was difficult. To solve this problem I contructed the adapters you can find here and use for your own work.

The adapters for the saws can be connected with the ones for the hoses by screwing them together.

#### Adapter for Metabo KGS 254 M

above: Metabo KGS 254 M with exhaustion adapter screwed into adapter for Generic amazon hose
To fix the adapter replace the two PT 4.2 x 9 screws with PT-screws 4.2 x 16.

#### Adapter for Einhell TC-TS 2025/2 U

To improve the hold of the adapter on the exhaustion connector of the Einhell use the washer (Dichtungsring) as seen above.

#### Adapter for ELU MH65

#### Filaments

For the adapters I used PLA from 3DJAKE
ecoPLA black [https://www.3djake.at/3djake/ecopla-schwarz](https://www.3djake.at/3djake/ecopla-schwarz)

For the washer of the Einhell adapter which has to be flexible I used
Recreus Filaflex Black [https://www.3djake.at/recreus/filaflex-black](https://www.3djake.at/recreus/filaflex-black)

### Ladder end cap

Some of the end caps for my aluminium ladders were lost, therefore I printed some new ones. The profiles of the ladder are 42 x 25 x 1,5 mm of size.

The brown cap has to be printed with flex filament and the grey cap with PLA. To mount them on the ladder first press the grey cap into the aluminium profile of the ladder and then the brown cap.

### Chips for birthdays, gifts, etc

![Geburtstags-Jeton](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50781679/169652170-7acd8364-2c69-4131-b33b-698a77449390.jpg)

#### Fusion 360

To change the text around the chip

1. Download [birthday_chip.f3d](https://github.com/hansratzinger/make3d/blob/main/models/chip/birthday_chip.f3d)
2. Open with Fusion 360
3. Delete the last two icons (scetch and extrusion) from the timeline.
 ![timeline_fusion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50781679/169653519-d0286fde-e1b9-468d-b92b-0b823ce9fe43.jpg)
4. Place an offset line around the chip where you want to place your curved text.
5. Create scetch
6. Select text from the create menue
7. Select text on path
![text on path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50781679/169652497-c2445006-1bb5-407f-830a-dfac24411b79.jpg)
9. Select a path for text to follow -> click on the offset line you created
10. Enter your text and select the height of the text
11. Close the text menue by pressing OK
12. Click right and select "Explode Text"

For the chip I used PLA from 3DJAKE
ecoPLA white [https://www.3djake.at/3djake/ecopla-weiss](https://www.3djake.at/3djake/ecopla-weiss)

### Rose plaque

We planted four new rose bushes and to remember the name of the roses I printed a bunch of rose badges to stick them into the soil.

![Rosen_Tafel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50781679/170283414-e96feef9-415e-410a-96eb-485834cc871a.jpg)

You can find an unlabelled model here:

### QWIRKLE stand

We very much like to play [QWIRKLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle). On this stand you can place your 6 QWIRKLE tiles.
