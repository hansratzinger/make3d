### Exhaustion adapters 

I was looking to improve the exhaustion of dust when I was working with my cirular saws. I am using a BOSCH GAS 20 L workshop vacuum cleaner and was connecting the hose by using a duck tape. But changing the hose to the different machines was difficult. To solve this problem I contructed the adapters you can find here and use for your own work.

The adapters for the saws can be connected with the ones for the hoses by screwing them together.

To fix the adapter change the two screws and use PT-screws 4.2 x 16 instead.

Please attach the washer to the adapter to tighten the adapter on the exhaustion tube of the Einhell saw.
